0.3.1	DEVELOPMENT
23.11.2002 (Release-Date)
- Fix implementation send in by Andy Jeffries, Email: opensource@andyjeffries.co.uk
  Description:
  I had a problem trying to convert a DBF file that was about 280Mb in size. 
  Basically you had a memory leak with your dynamically allocated buffers. [...]
  The 280Mb file I was converting was using memory like it was going out
  of fashion (getting up to 900Mb+ before being process-killed).  It now
  seems to use a constant 424Kb of memory (according to top).

0.2.5
15.09.2002 (Release-/Modification-Date)
- Implementation of Code Pages to view umlauts and special chars correctly (this
is a development feature which has to be tested by the people using dbf, because
I did not find any documentation about the reserved header bits in dbf III. At
the moment dbf controls the behaviour by Bit 31)

come
