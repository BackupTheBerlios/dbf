    <p><br>dbf is an easy-to-use command line tool to show and convert the content of 
       dBASE III, IV, and 5.0 files. It reads dBASE databases and prints the content to 
       the screen or converts it to comma-separated (*.csv) files which can be opened in
       Excel, StarOffice, and most other spread sheets. It can also be used to show some
       statistics about the content.
    </p>
    <h3>Easy handling</h3>
    <p>dbf is very easy to handle. The look-a-like orientates much on the command-line
       client of MySQL. Although the commands are quite different from the MySQL 
       command-line tool (and the fact that dbf is missing an interactive command shell),
       every user could learn very fast how to convert the dBASE files to CSV, 
       SQL instruction sets or printing the content to screen.
    </p>
    <h3>Support for common platforms and architectures</h3>
    <p>One of dbf's goals is the multi-platform-/multi-architecture support. Most dBASE
       applications are developed for Windows running on x86-architectures. With dbf you
       get support for dBASE also on UNIX, Linux, BSD, MacOS X and several other platforms.
       dbf is as portable as possible, so that it runs on Intel-based architectures (x86),
       PowerPC and Alpha/RISC architectures. Check out the system requirement pages and 
       see on how many platforms dbf was ported to until today.
    </p>
    <h3>Faaaaaast ...</h3>
    <p>With dbf 0.7 a lot of performance improvements were done on this small tool. The
       export in one of the two export formats is done in a few seconds (depending on 
       the size of your data sets) and that is also true for older, slower systems.
    </p>
    <h3>Only CSV? - not only...</h3>
    <p>CSV is a special file format, where all data-sets are separated by a comma or
       another user-defined sign. All common spread sheets, like Excel, OpenOffice
       (StarOffice) Calc, Softmaker Office and many more, support this format. It is
       very easy to import CSV-files to such spread sheets and to work on this imported
       data sets. With version 0.7, dbf supports also a way to define your own separator
       for the exported CSV file. dbf 0.7 orientates completely on the CSV standard.
    </p>   
    <h3>... but also SQL</h3>
    <p>The newest versions of dbf also support SQL as export file format. As result you
       get a file with a complete set of SQL statements. All you have to do is to copy
       the lines (or importing the file) into an administrative client. And it is very
       easy: The filename of the SQL instruction set will be also the name of the database
       you want to import the data.
