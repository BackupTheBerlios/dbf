There are several packages of dbf available. In the following, I will expalin
which package you need for your platform:

dbf-x.x.src.tar.gz:
-------------------
This package contains all sources and includes, the complete documentation but 
no binaries. You have to compile your own binaries with this package, this also
recommends several different development tools on your operating system.

dbf-x.x.bin.ELF.zip:
--------------------
This package contains a binary release for Linux/Unix operating systems which runs
on a x86 architecture.

dbf-x.x.bin.AXP.zip:
--------------------
This package contains a binary release Linux/Unix operating systems which runs on
an Alpha/RISC architecture.

dbf-x.x.bin.PPC.zip:
--------------------
This package contains a binary release Linux/Unix operating systems which runs on a
PowerPC architecture.

dbf-x.x.win.zip:
----------------
This package contains a binary release for Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP which runs 
on a x86 architecture.


These are installation instructions for dbf:

Linux
=====

Since version 0.3.2 dbf comes with a Makefile, which helps to install dbf
correctly. To change the directory you want to install dbf and change the entry
PREFIX = /usr/local/bin.

To install, type:

make

and as root:

make install (or su -c 'make install')

See FAQ first if you have installation problems.

See also README for more details on how to handle dbf and
http://anubisnet.sf.net/support.php for help on installation problems and
handling.


WINDOWS
=======

Versions below release 0.6
--------------------------

You have to compile dbf by hand, using any compiler you want to.
More information on http://anubisnet.sf.net/support or in the document FAQ
attached with the dbf package.

Versions since release 0.6
--------------------------

Since version 0.6 dbf contains a script to build the dbf executable very
easily. All you need is nmake and link32.exe and some libraries. The script
expects, that you have a development tool like Visual Studio installed.

In the root directory of the downloaded and extracted dbf-package, just
enter "compile.bat" in a command line an watch the output of compile.bat.

The created executable resides in src/Debug. You can copy it elsewhere.

If you want dbf executable from everywehre, add the path to dbf to %PATH%.


MAC OS
======

MacOS X:
--------

If you have installed a development environment based on the GNU tools, like
GCC and GDB, you can orientate on the Linux installation guide.	

MacOS < 10.x
------------

At the moment I cannot give installation instructions for Mac operating systems.
I hope this will change in the future.
