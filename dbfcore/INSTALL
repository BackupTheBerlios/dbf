INSTALL INSTRUCTION
===================

Document Version: 0.1
Autor: Björn Berg, clergyman@gmx.de



These are installation instructions for dbf

Linux
=====

Since version 0.3.2 dbf comes with a Makefile, which helps to install dbf
correctly. To change the directory you want to install dbf and change the entry
PREFIX = /usr/local/bin.

To install, type:

make

and as root:

make install

See FAQ first if you have installation problems.

See also README for more details on how to handle dbf and
http://anubisnet.sf.net/support.php for help on installation problems and
handling.


WINDOWS
=======

You have to compile dbf by hand, using any compiler you want to.
More information on http://anubisnet.sf.net/support or in the document FAQ
attached with the dbf package.


MAC OS
======

At the moment I cannot give installation instructions for Mac operating systems.
I hope this will change in the future.
