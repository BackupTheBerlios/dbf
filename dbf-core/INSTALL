PACKAGE DESCRIPTION
===================

There are several packages of dbf available. In the following, I will explain
which package you need for your platform:

dbf-x.x.src.tar.gz:
-------------------
This package contains all sources and includes, the complete documentation but
no binaries. You have to compile your own binaries with this package, this also
recommends several different development tools on your operating system.

dbf-x.x.bin.ELF.zip:
--------------------
This package contains a binary release for Linux/Unix operating systems which
runs on a x86 architecture.

dbf-x.x.bin.AXP.zip:
--------------------
This package contains a binary release Linux/Unix operating systems which runs
on an Alpha/RISC architecture.

dbf-x.x.bin.PPC.zip:
--------------------
This package contains a binary release Linux/Unix operating systems which runs
on a PowerPC architecture.

dbf-x.x.win.zip:
----------------
This package contains a binary release for Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP which 
runs on a x86 architecture. Windows XP Home Edition is not supported.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

These are installation instructions for dbf:

Linux
=====

Since version 0.3.2 dbf comes with a Makefile, which helps to install dbf
correctly. To change the directory you want to install dbf and change the entry
PREFIX = /usr/local/bin.

To install, type:

make

and as root:

make install (or su -c 'make install')

See FAQ first if you have installation problems.

See also README for more details on how to handle dbf and
http://anubisnet.sf.net/support.php for help on installation problems and
handling.


WINDOWS
=======

Versions below release 0.6
--------------------------

You have to compile dbf by hand, using any compiler you want to.
More information on http://anubisnet.sf.net/support or in the document FAQ
attached with the dbf package.

Versions since release 0.6
--------------------------

If you have Borland C Compiler installed, you can easily compile dbf
yourself. Just open a command line switch to dbf's src directory and
type in:

	make -f Makefile.bcc
	
BCC will create a binary named dbf.exe. If BCC is missing some Includes
or Libraries open the builtins.mak in the src-directory in any text-editor
of your choice and adopt the switches INCDIR and LIBDIR.

Former documentations stated also compilation with Microsofts nmake from
VisualStudio. This part is now deprecated because dbf.mak is no longer
up to date. And any try to use nmake with dbf.mak will fail.

For more information how to get and install BCC, please visit the following

MAC OS
======

MacOS X:
--------

If you have installed a development environment based on the GNU tools, like
GCC and GDB, you can orientate on the Linux installation guide.

MacOS < 10.x
------------

dbf is not compatible with older versions than MacOS X.
