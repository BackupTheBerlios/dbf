There are several packages of dbf available. In the following, I will expalin
which package you need for your platform:

dbf-x.x.src.tar.gz:
-------------------
This package contains all sources and includes, the complete documentation but 
no binaries. You have to compile your own binaries with this package, this also
recommends several different development tools on your operating system.

dbf-x.x.bin.ELF.zip:
--------------------
This package contains a binary release for Linux/Unix operating systems which run on a
x86 architecture.

dbf-x.x.bin.AXP.zip:
--------------------
This package contains a binary release Linux/Unix operating systems which run on an
Alpha/RISC architecture.

dbf-x.x.bin.PPC.zip:
--------------------
This package contains a binary release Linux/Unix operating systems which run on a
PowerPC architecture.

dbf-x.x.win.zip:
----------------
This package contains a binary release for Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP which run on a
x86 architecture.


These are installation instructions for dbf:

Linux
=====

Since version 0.3.2 dbf comes with a Makefile, which helps to install dbf
correctly. To change the directory you want to install dbf and change the entry
PREFIX = /usr/local/bin.

To install, type:

make

and as root:

make install

See FAQ first if you have installation problems.

See also README for more details on how to handle dbf and
http://anubisnet.sf.net/support.php for help on installation problems and
handling.


WINDOWS
=======

You have to compile dbf by hand, using any compiler you want to.
More information on http://anubisnet.sf.net/support or in the document FAQ
attached with the dbf package.


MAC OS
======

At the moment I cannot give installation instructions for Mac operating systems.
I hope this will change in the future.
