My thanks go to the following persons who assist me developing this tool:

Joachim Astel:
1998 Joachim Astel produced the first prototype of dbf in a nightly hack. 2002 I
have taken this code and wrapped more than 2500 lines of code around it.
Without Joachim dbf would not exist in the form as it does today. Parts of the
core (dbf.c) are still credited to him, although there were a lot of changes in
the last months.

Ed Guy:
hints how to convert symbols and characters in dBASE 3 files

Andy Jeffries, opensource@andyjeffries.co.uk:
memory leak fix, dbf now uses a constant memory of 424 KB during conversion of a
dBASE file. See CHANGELOG for more information.

Christian Vogel, chris@obelix.hedonism.cx:
Patch which changes all occurences of "char" to "unsigned char" in codepages.h of 
dbf-0.4. This avoids many warnings about "case statement out of range"

Ross Jones, ross@companyofarchers.org:
A lot of fixes and a helpful hand while porting dbf to PPC, especially MacOS X.

Dr. Georg Roesler:
- SQL Export
- Bugfixes and code optimization
